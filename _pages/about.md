I am Chris Weijenborg, an assistant professor at Wageningen University and Research. My research focusses on large-scale atmospheric dynamics in the midlatitudes. Currently I am mostly working on entangling the mechanisms behind cyclone clustering. I also generated a detection algorithm on cyclone clustering, some prelimanary results can be found in the blog section. 

If you are interested in doing a (master) thesis with me, please connect via email.
